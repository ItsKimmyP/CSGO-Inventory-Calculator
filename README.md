# Inventory Calculator

Simple CS:GO "Inventory Calculator" app that grabs the information present on www.csgobackpack.net and presents it in a compacted window with no extras. Any delays in retrieving these values are entirely from the website itself.

Values shown seem to update at 08:30 GMT, so please be advised real values may vary slightly.

"Possible Revenue" is calculated via a simple % calculation on your total inventory value using the default Valve market cut (15%). Actual revenue may vary slightly.

DISCLAIMER: Presented values are grabbed from the Steam Commmunity Market.
Certain item values may vary outside of it, usually being higher in the case of high-rarity items such as knives, therefore excercise caution and double check on reputable websites before selling any item you may suspect is worth more than Steam Community Market value.

TO DO: 
Add an option to view item values outside of the Steam Community Market.
Add graph showing pricing history for the viewed inventory.
Add option to view items in a grid (similar to the Inventory page within Steam).
